        <h2>Brief:</h2>
            <p>The project focused on facial feature recognition
                techniques and evaluating them in terms of accuracy
                and effectiveness. The goal is to explore the
                mechanics behind facial recognition.</p>

        <h2>Details:</h2>
        <p>Generally, face recognitions are accurate these
            days but when it comes to situations such as low
            image resolution, low contrast image and pose
            variations the system might fail to recognize
            face features. We looked at 3 different research
            studies for facial recognition and features that
            are more dominant in the face to allow for
            accurate facial detection.

    <h2>Process and Research</h2>
<p>We experimented with different images and recorded the
    results based on the studies. Facial detection works
    best when detecting eyes as one of the targets. It works
    least with detecting the nose. Additionally, having a
    low-resolution image, angled face, skin color also
    affects the accuracy at which an algorithm will work
    to detect the face.</p>
