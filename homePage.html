    <h1> Hi I'm Praneet.</h1>
    <p> I am a student persuing Interactive Arts and Technology Major
        and a Minor in Computing Science from Simon Fraser University.
        I focus my analytical skills and creativity into combining programming process
        with design-based solution generation techniques. I hope to persue my talents
        in programming with design for visual data generation and representation. I
        prioritize functionality and efficiency when working with programming algorithms
        and data structures. My skills allow me to incorporate physics principles in programming
        and convey the data through minimalistic design.</p>
