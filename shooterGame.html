        <p>A simple space shooter game developed in processing language
            using object-oriented programming and concepts such as collision
            detection, polymorphism, inheritance.</p>

        <h2>Details:</h2>
        <p>"Invasion" is a simple 2D shooter game that I developed in
            my first year course. The game was created from scratch
            with each element either created in processing or imported
            as a MS-Paint drawn object. The main objective was to learn
            object-oriented programming, overriding methods, detecting collisions
            between different objects and controlling objects on screen using keyboard.

            <li>Collision detection.</li>
            <li>Boss object spawn after significant number of enemies are killed.</li>
            <li>Animating objects upon interaction.</li>
            <li>Implementation of Physics in movement of the player.</li>

<div class="Process">
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>The process began with creating a general class for
        the main object which consisted of all the main
        attributes such as positioning, number of objects
        to spawn, rendering the object, movement and health.
        The class was defined as the character class.</p>

    <p>Subclasses for the character class were made which
        then took the role of the enemy, player and the boss
        in the game. Each class inherited the functionality
        of the character class but had their own specific
        methods and functionality as well.</p>


    <p>The most challenging aspect of the development
        process was detecting collisions among the enemy
        object and the player.</p>
